4. **Modularity**: Create a well-structured, maintainable codebase

## 2. Technical Approach and Methodology

### 2.1 System Architecture

The system follows a modular pipeline architecture:

```

- Robust to partial occlusions and perspective changes

#### 2. Adaptive Cost Matrix
```python
cost = 0.3 * iou_cost + 0.7 * feature_cost
```
- Balances geometric and appearance similarity
- Prevents impossible associations through thresholding
